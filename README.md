# Yew.rs Playground

It's research time, this repo will be where I am playing around with Yew.rs and technology. I am working on this both on my personal time, and live on my [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/brookzerker) stream.

## How this repo works

I'll have a single Yew.rs app with different where I'll be integrating technologies and patterns. Different branches will only be used if I experiment with libraries that are incompatible with each other.

## Things to Research

### Component Library

I'm a big fan of using a external component library for components that don't need to know about specific business logic. This would help us keep the components simple, extendable, and re-usable. I'll be creating the component library in [https://github.com/brooks-builds/yew_component_library](https://github.com/brooks-builds/yew_component_library)
